			<h3>A1 Black M1D1 - Thangs</h3>
			<p>
				The work on the A-side perfectly combines reduced house rhythms, deep sub frequencies
				seasoned with chords under the influence of dub techno music, periodically creating an
				atmospheric atmosphere as a contrast to the dirty production and street rap vocals that are
				dosed throughout the work as a guiding thread. However, it is not a hip house work in which
				the vocalist takes over the dominance, but pieces of the recorded male voice are literally
				used as a groove element, in places developing the narrative as an arrangement figure. Those
				who know me very well, are aware that I have been totally addicted to dub elements in
				electronic music ever since Basic Channel appeared, so this record was close to my heart
				from the first listen. Although it is not a musical revolution, but rather a combination of
				nostalgic elements from the rich history of electronic music.
			</p>
			<h3>B1 Black M1D1 - Diazepam</h3>
			<p>
				A raw production with a dark mood and a syncopated beat, intelligently continues the street
				vibe of the A-side. The atmosphere of a full-length thriller, vulgarisms, atonal sections
				and a bass drum that breaks kidney stones, is definitely not for the average listener of
				house music and similar genres, but the right team would enjoy every beat of this excellent
				arrangement.
